Sensor Snapshot

- A single-file web app that visualizes and compares today’s sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity) with the previous day’s data.
- On load, prompts for a location (default: “Home”) and generates a line chart comparing today and yesterday, with distinct color-coded lines and interactive legend.
- Implements in-memory data generation for two days (UTC-now and UTC-now - 24h), simulating realistic fluctuations (e.g., morning dip, afternoon peak, evening drop).
- Click/tap legend items to toggle visibility of each day’s line.
- Full keyboard navigation: tab through chart, legend, location input; space/enter toggles lines; arrow keys pan chart if zoomed.
- ARIA-compliant: chart and legend roles, live region for data changes, labels for all interactive elements, focus outlines.
- Print-friendly mode: on print, chart auto-expands to full width, legend moves below, monochrome line styles, “Print View” watermark.
- Persistence: stores location in localStorage; reload retains last location.
- Responsive design: adapts chart size and font for mobile and desktop; no horizontal scroll.
- Light/dark theme toggle via OS preference (prefers-color-scheme).
- Status bar shows current time, location, and data refresh timestamp.
- “Export PNG” button downloads the current chart view as an image.
- Help tooltip explains keyboard shortcuts on first visit (dismissible, also stored in localStorage).
- Minimal, semantic HTML5; inline CSS and vanilla JS; no external dependencies.
- All text and UI elements support i18n placeholders.
- Clear error states: invalid input, failed localStorage, etc.
- Testable features: location persistence, keyboard toggling, print view, PNG export, theme switch, help tooltip.
