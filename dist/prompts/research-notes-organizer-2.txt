Research Notes Organizer

- Build a single-file web app for managing research notes, supporting offline-first operation with localStorage.
- Users can add, edit, and delete notes, each with a title and rich text content (basic formatting: bold, italic, lists).
- Notes are automatically saved as they are edited; changes persist across browser restarts.
- Include a search bar to filter notes by title or content.
- Add a print-friendly view that hides UI controls and displays only note content, suitable for printing or PDF export.
- Implement a dark/light theme toggle that remembers user preference and auto-switches based on system preference by default.
- Ensure full keyboard navigation: tab through notes, use Enter to edit, Escape to cancel, and Delete to remove.
- All code (HTML, CSS, JS) must be in one file; no external libraries or files.
