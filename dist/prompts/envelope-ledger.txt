Envelope Ledger

- Single-file HTML app with inline CSS and JavaScript, no external dependencies
- Envelope-based budgeting system: users create spending categories (envelopes) with monthly allocations
- Add transactions by envelope, amount, date, and optional description; transactions persist via localStorage
- Dashboard displays: total budgeted amount, total spent, remaining balance per envelope, and overall budget health
- Responsive grid layout (mobile-first, adapts to desktop) showing envelopes as cards with allocation bars
- Drag-and-drop to reorder envelopes; click envelope to view/manage its transactions
- Dark mode auto-detects system preference (prefers-color-scheme) with manual toggle in header
- Transaction list per envelope shows date, amount, description; delete individual transactions with confirmation
- Monthly reset button to clear spent amounts while preserving envelope structure
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through envelopes, Enter to expand, Escape to collapse, arrow keys to navigate transactions
- Export button downloads current envelope data as JSON; import button restores from JSON file
- Visual indicators: warning state when envelope spending exceeds 80%, critical state at 100%+
- Simple form to add new envelopes with name and initial allocation; form validation prevents empty names or negative amounts
- Persistent data: all envelopes, allocations, and transactions saved to browser localStorage; survives page refresh
- Footer shows last updated timestamp and data size indicator
