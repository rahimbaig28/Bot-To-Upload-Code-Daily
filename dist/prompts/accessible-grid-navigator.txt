Accessible Grid Navigator

- Single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external libraries).
- Displays a responsive grid of focusable cells (minimum 4x4, scalable with screen size).
- Each cell can contain user-editable text or labels.
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys: moves focus cell-to-cell in all directions.
- Supports quick jump keys: Home (first cell), End (last cell), Ctrl+Arrow for row/column jumps.
- Screen reader friendly: proper ARIA roles and live region updates announcing focused cell coordinates and content.
- Provides controls to export the entire gridâ€™s content and state as a JSON file.
- Allows importing a JSON file to restore grid content and focus position.
- Print-friendly view toggle: reformats grid for clean print layout, hides navigation controls.
- Persistent storage of grid content and focus position using localStorage, auto-saves on edits and navigation.
- Responsive layout that adapts gracefully from mobile to desktop widths with readable font sizes.
- Accessible color scheme with high contrast and visible focus outlines.
- All interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard only (tab order, focus management).
