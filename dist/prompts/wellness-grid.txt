Wellness Grid

- A responsive, ARIA-compliant web app for tracking personal health habits and mood in a visual, drag-and-drop grid.
- Single HTML file with inline CSS/JS; no external libs; full keyboard navigation.
- Users add daily habits (e.g., hydration, exercise, meditation) as draggable, resizable tiles to a customizable grid.
- Each tile supports quick status toggles (done/skipped), color-coded notes, and streak counters—all persisted to localStorage.
- Mood tracker: Drag a mood emoji onto the grid each day; log is visible in a timeline view.
- Responsive grid auto-adjusts to screen size; tiles can be reordered via drag-and-drop (mouse and keyboard).
- Accessibility: All controls labeled with aria-label; focus styles; skip links; high-contrast mode toggle.
- Export/import grid and log data as JSON (copy-paste).
- Testable features: Add/remove habit tiles, drag to reorder, toggle status, log mood, persist on refresh, export/import data, full keyboard nav.
- Constraints: No server; all data client-side; under 1000 LOC.
