Research Reference Grid

- A single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript, no external libraries).
- Displays a responsive grid of user-added research references, each with fields: Title, Authors, Publication Year, Source/URL, and Notes.
- Supports adding, editing, and deleting references in-place with form validation.
- Implements undo and redo functionality for all user actions (add, edit, delete).
- Saves all data persistently using localStorage to retain references between sessions.
- Provides a print-friendly view accessible via a button that formats the grid for clean paper output.
- Keyboard accessible: tab navigation, Enter to submit forms, Escape to cancel editing, and shortcut keys for undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y).
- Responsive layout: grid adapts to screen size with columns adjusting from one column on narrow screens up to four columns on wide screens.
- Includes a search/filter box to dynamically filter displayed references by title, author, or source.
- Minimalist, clean UI with subtle styling emphasizing readability and usability.
