Micro Grid Dash

- A single-file responsive micro game web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JS; no external libraries).
- The core gameplay is a fast-paced grid-based challenge where the player controls a single active cell on a responsive square grid (minimum 4x4, scalable up to 10x10 based on viewport).
- Each round, the grid highlights a new random target cell; the player must move the active cell to the target using keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left, right) as quickly as possible.
- Correct moves increment score and immediately spawn a new random target cell; missing or moving outside grid resets streak.
- The app automatically adapts grid size and cell dimensions to viewport width and height for consistent UX across devices.
- The game state (score, current target location, active cell position, and streak) persists in localStorage to survive page reloads.
- The URL hash encodes current score and streak for easy sharing; loading a URL with this hash initializes the game state accordingly.
- Visual feedback: active cell distinct color, target cell highlighted, and streak multiplier shown prominently.
- Keyboard-first UX: fully playable with keyboard only, including restart (R key), pause (P key), and sound toggle (S key).
- Minimalist UI with clear, high-contrast colors and accessible font sizes.
- The app includes a start screen with instructions and a reset button, all keyboard accessible.
- No mouse/touch dependencies, but supports tab navigation and ARIA roles for accessibility.
