ChronoList: Time-Stamped Daily Task Tracker with Undo/Redo and JSON Sync

- Single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript, no external libraries).
- Maintains a continuous, append-only daily task log separated by UTC date headers (e.g., "2025-11-06") displayed in chronological order.
- Users can add tasks with optional time stamps and short notes; tasks appear under each day’s heading.
- Tasks can be marked complete/incomplete; completed tasks visually distinct and remain in the daily log.
- Supports editing and deleting tasks inline.
- Undo and redo functionality supporting all task modifications (add, edit, delete, complete toggle) with multiple levels.
- Keyboard-first UX: keyboard shortcuts for creating new tasks (Enter), navigating tasks (arrow keys), toggling complete (Space), undo (Ctrl+Z), redo (Ctrl+Y), and focusing input.
- Filtering by date and keyword search bar to quickly find tasks anywhere in the log.
- Export and import the entire log as JSON for backup or syncing; import merges or replaces the current data.
- Persist task log in localStorage to survive browser reloads and sessions.
- Responsive layout with accessible color contrast and semantic HTML for screen readers.
- Auto-scroll to the most recent day’s tasks on load.
- Minimal UI clutter: clean, scrollable vertical list grouped by day with date headings pinned during scroll.
- Data model internally stores tasks with timestamp, text, completion state, and unique IDs to support undo/redo.
- No external dependencies or network calls; all data and logic contained in the single file.
