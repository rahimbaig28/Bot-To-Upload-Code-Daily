Research Insight Collector

- Single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies).
- Purpose: Enable researchers to gather, organize, and share concise research notes and key insights efficiently.
- Features:
  - Add, edit, and delete note cards with title, tags, and content fields.
  - Search and filter notes by keywords and tags in real-time.
  - Sort notes by creation or modification date.
  - Assign multiple tags per note; tags are manageable with an autocomplete dropdown.
  - URL hash-based sharing: encode current filter and sorting state in the URL hash for easy sharing and restoring of the view.
  - Offline-first: all notes are stored and loaded from localStorage, enabling full functionality without internet.
- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles and attributes for all interactive elements (e.g., note cards, buttons, search input).
  - Keyboard navigation support: tab ordering, keyboard shortcuts for adding notes (e.g., Ctrl+N), deleting selected note (e.g., Delete key), and focusing search.
- UI:
  - Responsive layout suitable for desktop and tablets.
  - Clear visual focus indicators for keyboard users.
  - Minimalist design emphasizing readability and fast scanning of notes.
- Performance:
  - Efficient DOM updates for search/filter/sort operations without page reload.
- No backend or external calls; fully client-side.
- Save and restore all user data and UI state (notes, tags, filters, sorting) across browser sessions using localStorage.
