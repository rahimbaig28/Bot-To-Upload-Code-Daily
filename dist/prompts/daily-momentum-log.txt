Daily Momentum Log

A single-file web app for capturing daily work and reflecting on accomplishments. Users append timestamped entries throughout the day, then review what they completed at day's end. Designed for keyboard-first interaction and offline persistence.

CORE FEATURES:
- Auto-dated daily section that creates a new entry each calendar day
- Quick-add input field with Ctrl+Enter to append timestamped tasks/notes
- Separate "Done" and "Pending" sections within each day (drag empty line between them to mark completion)
- Full-text search across all historical entries
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive 2-column grid layout: left column shows current day, right shows search results or historical weeks
- All data persists to browser localStorage; export/import as plaintext

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
- Ctrl+Enter: submit new entry
- Ctrl+F: focus search box
- Ctrl+T: toggle theme
- Ctrl+E: export all entries as .txt file
- Ctrl+I: show import dialog

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Semantic HTML with ARIA labels
- All functions accessible via keyboard (no mouse required)
- High contrast mode support via prefers-color-scheme

PERSISTENCE:
- localStorage key: "momentumLog" stores JSON array of daily objects
- Each day object contains: date, entries array, completed count
- Auto-save on every keystroke

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
- On mobile (< 640px): single column, hide historical view
- On desktop: grid splits current day left, search/history right
- Readable line length (max 70ch per column)
