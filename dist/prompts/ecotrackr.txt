EcoTrackr

- User-facing, single-file web app (HTML/CSS/JS, no external dependencies) for tracking personal sustainability goals.
- Real-time carbon footprint dashboard: user inputs daily activities (commute, diet, energy use, water), app calculates and graphs daily/weekly CO₂e (carbon dioxide equivalent) impact.
- ARIA-compliant, keyboard-navigable form inputs and interactive charts (tab focus, screen reader labels, high-contrast theme).
- Full undo/redo stack for all user entries (localStorage-backed).
- Dynamic URL hash encodes current view and data filters (e.g., #week=2&view=chart) for easy sharing and bookmarking.
- Responsive layout (mobile-first, no horizontal scroll).
- Persistence: All data saved to localStorage; import/export as JSON via file API.
- Testable features:
  - Add/remove/edit activity entries with instant CO₂e recalculation.
  - Toggle between daily list and weekly chart views.
  - Undo/redo last change (max 20 steps).
  - Copy/shareable URL with current state in hash.
  - Import/export full dataset as JSON file.
  - All interactive elements keyboard navigable and ARIA-labeled.
  - Visual feedback on changes (e.g., entry highlight, undo/redo button state).
  - Responsive to window resize; no external CSS/JS frameworks.
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML, ARIA roles/states, keyboard shortcuts (tab, enter, esc), high-contrast toggle.
- Bonus: Simple “tips” panel with daily sustainability suggestions (localized to user’s region via navigator.language).
- Constraints: No external network requests; all logic, styles, and data in one HTML file; no build step.
