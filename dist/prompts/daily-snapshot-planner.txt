Daily Snapshot Planner

- Single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript; no external dependencies).
- Core feature: Each day gets a dedicated section generated automatically with the current date stamp (UTC).
- Users can add tasks, notes, and quick reflections in a grid layout with resizable and reorderable cards.
- Responsive grid that adapts from single column on narrow screens to multi-column on wider screens.
- Tasks can be marked complete with a checkbox; completed tasks visually fade but remain editable.
- Supports lightweight tagging by typing hashtags within tasks or notes.
- Daily sections automatically collapse or expand; user can manually toggle visibility.
- Print-friendly mode: clean, minimal styling suitable for printing or PDF export, showing only tasks and notes without UI controls.
- Offline-first functionality: all data persists in browser localStorage, enabling full use without internet.
- Keyboard accessible: tab navigation through tasks, Enter to add new task, Space to toggle complete, Ctrl+Arrow keys to reorder tasks.
- Search/filter input at top filters visible tasks/notes by text or tags in real time.
- Simple export/import JSON feature for backup and restore of entire data.
- On load, app resumes at last-opened day section.
- Minimal UI with emphasis on quick capture and daily review to enhance personal productivity.
