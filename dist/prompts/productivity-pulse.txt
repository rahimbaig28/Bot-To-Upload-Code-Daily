Productivity Pulse

- Single-file app (HTML with inline CSS/JS, or Python 3 with no external files).
- Core purpose: Visualize daily/weekly productivity pulse by tracking task completion, mood, and energy levels, all in one view.
- Keyboard-first UX: All main features accessible without mouse (tab, enter, arrow keys, shortcuts—e.g., Ctrl-N for new task, Ctrl-D for done, Ctrl-E for edit).
- Dark/light auto theme: Detect OS preference, toggle with Ctrl-T.
- Daily pulse view: Stacked bar chart showing completed vs. planned tasks per hour; color-coded by mood/energy (green=high, yellow=medium, red=low).
- Task entry: Quick-add with title, optional tags (#work, #health, #learn), and estimated duration. Mark complete/incomplete with keyboard.
- Mood/energy logging: After each task, prompt for mood (1–5) and energy (1–5); log timestamped.
- Weekly summary: Aggregate view of tasks, mood, energy trends. Export/import full data as JSON (localStorage for web, JSON file for Python).
- Search/filter: Live search by tag, date, or keyword. Filter by mood/energy level.
- Persistence: All data saved automatically (localStorage or JSON file). No signup, no cloud.
- Accessibility: High-contrast themes, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation fully documented in-app.
- Minimal UI: No modal dialogs. All editing inline. No unnecessary animations.
- Testable features: Add/complete/edit tasks, log mood/energy, view daily/weekly charts, search/filter, export/import JSON, theme toggle, full keyboard control.
- Implementable in <1000 lines, standards-compliant, no external deps.
- Distinct from previous apps: Focus on holistic productivity (tasks + well-being), not just lists or timers. Pulse visualization is central.
