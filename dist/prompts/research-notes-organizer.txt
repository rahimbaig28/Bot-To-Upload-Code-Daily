Research Notes Organizer

- Single-file web app (one HTML file) with inline CSS and JavaScript; no external libraries or resources.
- Purpose: Allow researchers to quickly capture, organize, and review brief research notes and references.
- Main features:
  - Add/edit/delete notes with these fields: title, content (rich text or markdown-style), tags (comma separated), and optional URL reference.
  - Notes list view with search/filter by text and tags.
  - Each note can be expanded/collapsed; keyboard accessible (tab, enter, arrow keys).
  - Tags are clickable to filter notes by tag.
  - Persist all notes and UI state in localStorage for instant data retrieval on page reload.
  - Export current notes collection as a JSON file.
  - Import notes from a valid JSON file, merging or replacing existing notes.
  - Generate a shareable URL by encoding current notes and filters into the URL hash for easy sharing/bookmarking.
- Accessibility:
  - Fully ARIA-compliant semantic elements and roles for screen readers.
  - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements (adding, editing, filtering, exporting, importing).
- UI:
  - Responsive and clean minimalist design focused on clarity and usability.
  - Clear visual focus indicators for keyboard users.
- Bonus:
  - Confirmation prompts on destructive actions (delete, import overwrite).
  - Search box autofocus on page load.
- Limitations:
  - Entire app must fit within a single HTML file under ~1000 lines.
  - No backend or server dependencies; all data managed client-side.
